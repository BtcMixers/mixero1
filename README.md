Service Fees

In fact, choosing higher fees allows your transaction to have a higher priority level. Each fee value uses a different protocol allowing for faster transactions. This is an average delay of about one hour with high fees and about 3 hours with lower fees. The exact delay cannot be predicted due to variations in the blockchain.

The fixed fees that our technologies take 0.0003 BTC allow us to continue improving our protocols and adding features. It is necessary to send at least 0.002 BTC and a maximum of 250.00 BTC. If you send less, your money will not be sent to the destination and will be perceived as a donation.
